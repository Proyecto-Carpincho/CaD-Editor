## Cinematic Player

### Creation
It is created as a **normal node** and assigned the corresponding resource.  
Once done, the editor will automatically open.

*(Image here)*

With a **right-click**, a window will appear to select the nodes, with an appearance like this:

*(Image here)*

At the bottom, you will find a button called **"View Console"**, which opens a mini console that displays errors generated during use.

*(Image here)*

In the **Inspector**, you will see 3 tabs (if `ImportData` is available; otherwise, only 2 will be visible).

### Paths

#### `VAR NodePaths`
A list of nodes that can be used by other nodes for various options.  
Examples: `MethodNode`, `DialogicNode`, `WaitSignal`.

#### `VAR AnimationPlayers`
A list of `AnimationPlayer` nodes that can be used to animate through `AnimationNode`.

> [!WARNING]  
> Be careful when **modifying these lists during runtime**, as the nodes may not be found correctly or may not be found at all.

### Autoload Dialogue

#### `VAR DialogueFile`
The file where the dialogues are searched.  

> [!NOTE]  
> This plugin **does not require Godot localization**.  
> It always takes the **first line as the key** and the **second line as the text to display**, regardless of the default language.

#### `VAR AutoloadDialog`
The autoload that can be used for dialogues.  

> [!NOTE]  
> This **does not mean the plugin strictly requires** an autoload.  
> Nodes from the `NodePaths` list can be chosen instead.  
> Even between one node and another, an autoload can be selected.

#### `VAR DialogMethod`
The method that will be called for dialogues that use an autoload.  

> [!WARNING]  
> When changing the selected autoload, **reload the inspector by changing the selected node**.  
> This behavior is designed to improve performance.

#### `VAR SignalName`
The signal that will be emitted in case you are using an autoload along with a signal.

### All Data

This section contains the **variables you created** in the **CaD editor** using `ImportData`.

> [!NOTE]  
> If you want to **modify or access these variables via code**, **do not** use the following:  
> ```gdscript
> get_node("CinematicPlayer").YourCreatedVariableName
> ```
>  
> Instead, use this approach:  
> ```gdscript
> get_node("CinematicPlayer").dicImportVar[YourCreatedVariableName]
> ```

## Editor

The **Cinematic Editor** works as follows:

- Every cinematic always starts from the **`StartNode`**.  
  *(Image here)*

- For a node to be executed, it **must be connected** to another node.  
  Example:  
  *(Image here)*

- Nodes are executed **step by step**, following their connections in sequence.

- When a node connected to an **`EndNode`** is reached (regardless of whether other nodes are still running),  
  the editor will emit the signal **`CinematicEND`**.
