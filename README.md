# CaD Editor

**CaD** is a plugin for Godot that acts as a graph editor, designed to be the core of your cinematics. Its main goal is to flexibly redirect data to the nodes or systems you need.

> [!NOTE]  
> Unlike tools like [**Dialogic!**](https://github.com/dialogic-godot/dialogic), which follow a predefined and less customizable structure, **CaD** works as a modular engine that enables personalized redirection of your cinematic data.
